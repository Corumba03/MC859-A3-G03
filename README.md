How to run the solver:

1) Set the following parameters on main.py

obj_function: the function to be evaluated
iterations: number of iterations without improvement before stopping
tenure: size of the Tabu list, leave as 0 for a dynamic size
constructive_type: one of ['std']
search_type: Choose between 'first' (for first improving) or 'best' (for best improving)
tabu_check: Choose between 'strict' (to tabu any moves using the element tabu) or 'relaxed' (to tabu only the specific move used)
maximize (optional): False if you want to minimize the function, True otherwise (it is True by default)

2) Set the 'minutes' variable in runner.py to specify the maximum amount of minutes before a timeout

3) Run runner.py
